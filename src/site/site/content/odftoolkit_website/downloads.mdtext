**Current Version**

The ODF Toolkit team is pleased to announce the double release of 0.9.0 and 1.0.0 on January 27th, 2020.

* The release 0.9.0 is using JDK 8 with ODF 1.2 and for the final time including the Simple API - a fork once made by IBM but no longer maintained, containg too much copy/pasted functionality.
* The release 1.0.0 is using >=JDK 9 with ODF 1.2, [providing a new collaboration feature]() and adding more than half a dozen years of development by merging the ODFDOM fork of [Open-XChange's browser office OX Documents](https://www.open-xchange.com/portfolio/ox-documents/).

The current version is the 1.0.0 release. The future development is based on 1.0.0.

A full list of changes is available in the [change log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdf/odftoolkit/master/CHANGES.txt). People interested should also follow the [mail list](mailing-lists.html) to track progress.
